CISTEM is a stemming algorithm for the german language, developed by Leonie Wei√üweiler and Alexander Fraser. This repository contains official implementations in a variety of programming languages. At the moment, Perl is the only language
available, with Python and Java planned for the immediate future.

## Performance
We performed a comparative analysis of six publicly available German stemmers, where CISTEM achieved the best results for f-measure and state-of-the-art
results for runtime.
